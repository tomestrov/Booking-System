# CPTR 142: Project III

## Problem Overview

For this project, we will be creating a Holiday Booking system to allow a 
user to select the best options for their next trip! It should allow a user

your projected costs for each trip, and when prompted show a breakdown of all the costs.

## Solution Specifications
